This directory contains the Cinema 4D project files.

- **`headphone-holder.c4d`** is the main Cinema project file and changes are made to it first. The arty-farty renders are from here.

- **`headphone-holder-spin.c4d`** is the project file for the spinning, looping animation. The headphone model is not included in this, and Sketch & Toon rendering is enabled.

- **`tex/`** is the textures directory created by Cinema. The two textures in it are used by the primary Cinema project file for the headphone model.
